# Pesto Assignments

Welcome to Pesto assignments.


## How to solve assignments

Weekly Assignments will be shared by your mentor or instructor.

Make sure master or main branch is protected and you are not able to push any code directly to master.

- Clone this repo to your local.
- Checkout to new branch for submission. Suggestion you can name new branch week wise - branch for week 1 assignment can be week1
```bash
git checkout -b week1
```
- Create Assignment week folder in root directory(if it doesn't exist) for eg. for solving week 1 assignment create folder with name "week1".
- You can create subfolders in main week(week1) folder if required.
- Add proper readme [(How to Write proper readme](https://meakaakka.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3) )in week's folder or subfolder explaining about assignment, how to run assignment and any other instructions. 
- Raise a PR against master and add your mentor as reviewer
- Resolve PR comments if any and once your mentor approves your PR, Merge it.
